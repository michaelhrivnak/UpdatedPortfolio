                <p>My path to web development has been a long and winding road that began as a child, learning Basic from floppy discs on my family's 486 machine.
                    I strayed from this path many times over the years but have since found my way back in the last couple of years assisting on a web development
                    project at my day job. Recently I've spent a lot of time thinking about User Interfaces and User Experience; the topic fascinates
                    me and I aim to explore it in much more depth in the future.

                <p>When I'm not at work drawing up floor plans I can usually be found playing the latest digital card game (right now its Magic: The Gathering Arena).
                    For many years growing up I wanted to be a game developer but while game design and game systems interest me a great deal, I do not have the hands
                    for art, which has lead me more to thinking about overall design principles and UX.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I have even more free time I love to explore the city and find new restaurants to try with my wife or even find a new and interesting recipe to try
                    to make at home. I am always trying to add my own spin to a recipe, as I am constantly thinking about how to improve or alter things. This can lead
                    to disastrous results though!
                </p>
